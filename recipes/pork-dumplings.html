    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pork dumplings are savory, bite-sized delights filled with seasoned ground 
        pork, wrapped in a thin dough, and either steamed, boiled, or pan-fried. 
        They are a popular dish in Chinese cuisine, often served with dipping sauces.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>1 Â¾ pounds ground pork</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, 
            egg and cabbage in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. 
            Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. 
            Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly 
            floured surface until ready to cook.</p></li>
        <li><p>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't 
            touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam until pork is cooked 
            through, about 15 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p></li>
    </ol>
